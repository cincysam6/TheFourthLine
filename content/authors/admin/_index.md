My name is Samuel Kirschner and this is my personal website tracking all of my public analytics work. I currently work at NCSolutions as a Director of Research and Development creating products that use casual inference to understand the effects of ad campaigns on sales for CPG brands. In addition, I work on projects to help better understand and target consumers for these ad campaigns.

The creation of this blog was spurred on by the realization that as I came into more of a manager role, my responsibilities shifted and I wasn't spending as much time coding in R as I would like. Additionally, I've watched from the sidelines the growth in sports analytics over the past 3-4 years, but hesitated participating because frankly 14 hours at my desk all day between my job and that hobby sounded unappealing. However, recognizing my skills were atrophying as I focused on more strategic work for my organization, I decided this might be a good time to create this blog and start flexing those muscles again. Frankly, I didn't get into my line of work because of a deep love of advertising, but rather I love to create and I love to learn about human decision making through a rigorous, empirical process many call analytics or data science.

This blog will be a collection of blog posts and projects mainly focused on sports analytics, economics, and environmental work. My goal is to better chronicle my work for future reference, but also act as a teaching device for others and hopefully fill a space between introductory lessons and the bleeding edge work I often see in abundance. If you are looking for any market research work, you are out of luck because that will be saved for my professional life. As a lifelong Cincinnati sports fan, you can expect a lot of Bengals and Reds posts, in addition to more general work on the NFL, NHL, and soccer which will be my primary sports of interest.
